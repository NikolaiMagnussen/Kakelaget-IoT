Important elements can be marked to be shown in the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Additionally the elements can be grouped into rooms. <br><br>Every change of a sensor value or a switching status is called an <strong>Event</strong> and is shown in the <strong>Timeline</strong>. Filtering allows monitoring the changes of one single function or device. <br><br>All other functions such as time triggered actions, the use of information from the Internet, scenes plugin of other technologies and service are realized in <strong>Apps</strong>.
